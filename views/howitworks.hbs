  <p> <b>FEEDER STAGE</b></p>
  <p> In the stage, you get 100% ROI on your matrix and also get 100% referral bonus from each of your referrals as long as you keep re entering the stage. This is done to enable fairness and help your sponsor refer more persons for you if you can not refer. <br><br> How it is done is this; your first leg pays to you, your second pays to your sponsor while your third leg pays to you.To solve this is very easy as the formula is (Referral income per one x number of referrals for upgrade). So if you refer 1 person, you have 10,000 x 1 which is N10,000 referral bonus. Ten persons have 10,000 x 10 = N100,000 referral bonus! <br><br> </p>

  <p>Since this matrix is just one level deep, and you  need only three referrals, once you max out, you are to re enter the matrix again so you can keep earning.
